# spotikiosk
**SpotiKiosk** is a self-hosted Spotify “Now Playing” kiosk designed for bars, cafés, and venues. It displays the currently playing track with album art, progress bar, and an optional scrolling ticker (text or RSS).  Runs locally, works offline-friendly, and is built for always-on screens.
